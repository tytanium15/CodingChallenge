### This is a web application for searching and displaying movies.
### This project uses the TMDB API to fetch movie information.

## Setup

In order to run this code, first download this repository to your local computer.
Once inside the folder, go to the webapp folder and run **'npm run serve'**
This will run the front-end of the application on port 8080.
Next, go to the webservice folder and run **'node index.js'**
This will run the back-end of the application on port 3000.
After the front-end and back-end are up and running, simply go to localhost:8080 and you will be able to type in a movie title and search for results.

## Thoughts

If I had more time to work on this application, I would try to better optimize the design for desktop since there is a lot of white space still. I think I would also try to make a pager for more results.
